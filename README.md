Repository for automatically fetching aoc input and uploading my solutions.

When extending the Solution class, the executed code will automatically get timed, so will always know how efficient

You can also specify the wanted amount of iterations per solution, in order to let the JIT do its magic and optimize 
the runtime over multiple iterations.
